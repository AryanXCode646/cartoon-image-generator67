Legacy placeholder.

The cloud Ghibli generator that called external APIs has been disabled
to keep this project fully local and independent of any API keys or
billing limits.

All recommended usage is now via the local enhanced GUI:

    cd "C:\\Users\\aryan\\Desktop\\cartoon image generater\\Easy_cartoonify"
    python launch_enhanced.py

and selecting the "Anime Ghibli" / "Paprika Vibrant" styles, which use
AnimeGANv2 + local post‑processing.
